# Code Samples

I maintain code samples in this repository. I also track things I do for practice in my own time.

## Engineering

- Python - numpy v other array frameworks, lower level (e.g. C) and their differences (build numpy from source)
- Database and backend for CIC project.

## NLP

1. LLM - Self Attention to Multi Head Attention to Transformers. Tokenization and embeddings. (started)
2. LLM - encoder-only BERT v decoder-only GPT
3. LLM - other architectures, Vision or multi-modal
4. LLM - RLHF v SFT v PPO, InstructGPT, sample size needed, why RL, comparison to other RL policy algorithms
5. LLM - using DeepSeek locally
6. LLM versus traditional statistical sequential models (e.g. HMM) used for e.g. NER tasks

## Data Science & Operations

1. ILP / Gruboi solver - business constraint and resource allocation - it would be cool to try out their API. Can I get good approximation with relaxed LP (soft constraints)? can I get good initialization with continuous optimization, and will that help solve an LP - optimizers? Cost benefit of relaxed solution with cheaper solver v. exact solution with commercial solver that has subscription cost, for Traveling Salesman.
2. Finish my CIC project.
