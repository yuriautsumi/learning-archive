Chapter 14: Feedback and Flip-Flops
-concept of flip-flop circuit and "memory"
-it lets us maintain memory, giving us multiple stable states 
-Example: Reset-Set (R-S) flip flop: composed of two NOR gates
  -has property that output Q and Q bar are complements (restricts inputs)
  -2 inputs can either Set or Reset output Q
  -2 inputs can be both set to 0 to get last value of Q
  -Diagram:
   -|R  Q |-
   -|S  Q'|-
